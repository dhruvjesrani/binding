                This website hosts three articles that intertwine around the theme of inclusions and exclusions in the field of design and design thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                These articles discuss the western thoughts, ideas and influences that have taken over the design world and branded themselves as being “universal” and for the “normal” user, while excluding anything and anyone that lies outside this bubble. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The three articles talk about the role of colonization, race and white supremacy in deciding who facilitates, participates and gets left out from the design process, while calling for designers to be more inclusive in order to break out of their echo-chambers and open the field to greater innovation, ideas and thoughts.
